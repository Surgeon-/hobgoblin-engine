# ProofOfConceptProjects
Projects which are used either to develop future Hobgoblin features, or depend on
Hobgoblin and serve as showcases and examples of its usage. They also test whether the API is user-friendly, so
they are placed in the same repository for faster development in case something needs to be changed.

### Directories:
 - **Raynor:** Raytracing app.
 - **SpaceshipPhysics:** Some old code in the process of being deprecated and deleted.
 - **Typhon:** A small showcase game which utilizes Hobgoblin. The name was chosen arbitrarily.
