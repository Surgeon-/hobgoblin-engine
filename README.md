# Hobgoblin

This repository houses Hobgoblin, a "small and simple (well, small at least) game engine, intended to serve as a
basis for small ~~and simple~~ games", unit tests for the engine and some example projects. 


### Directories:
 - **Dependencies:** Prebuilt libraries (mainly, SFML) on which Hobgoblin depends on. Note to self: I really
should start using Conan for this...
 - **Hobgoblin:** The engine itself.
 - **HobgoblinTest:** Unit tests for the engine.
 - **SimplePlatformer:** A small showcase game which uses Hobgoblin.
 - **SpaceshipPhysics:** Some old horrible code which may or may not compile successfully. Not really related
to any of the above.


Most of the directories have their own Readme file which describes relevant contents in more detail.
