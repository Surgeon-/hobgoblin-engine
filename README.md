# Hobgoblin

This repository houses Hobgoblin, a "small and simple (well, small at least) game engine, intended to serve as a
basis for small ~~and simple~~ games", unit tests for the engine and some example projects. 


### Directories:
 - **Dependencies:** Prebuilt libraries (mainly, SFML) on which Hobgoblin depends on. Note to self: I really
should start using Conan for this...
 - **Hobgoblin:** The engine itself.
 - **HobgoblinTest:** Unit tests for the engine.
 - **SpaceshipPhysics:** Some old horrible code which may or may not compile successfully. Not really related
to anything.
 - **Typhon:** A small showcase game which uses Hobgoblin. The name was chones arbitrarily.


Most of the directories have their own Readme file which describes relevant contents in more detail.
