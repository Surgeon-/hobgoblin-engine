# Hobgoblin

This repository houses Hobgoblin, a "small and simple (well, small at least) game engine, intended to serve as a
basis for small ~~and simple~~ games", unit tests for the engine and some example projects. 


### Directories:
 - **Engine:** The engine itself.
 - **ProofOfConceptProjects:** Projects which are used either to develop future Hobgoblin features, or depend on
Hobgoblin and serve as showcases and examples of its usage. They also test whether the API is user-friendly, so
they are placed in the same repository for faster development in case something needs to be changed.


Most of the directories have their own Readme file which describes relevant contents in more detail.
