# Hobgoblin

This repository houses Hobgoblin, a "small and simple (well, small at least) game engine, intended to serve as a
basis for small ~~and simple~~ games", unit tests for the engine and some example projects. 


### Directories:
 - **Hobgoblin:** The engine itself.
 - **HobgoblinTest:** Unit tests for the engine.
 - **SpaceshipPhysics:** Some old code in the process of being deprecated and deleted.
 - **Typhon:** A small showcase game which utilizes Hobgoblin. The name was chosen arbitrarily.


Most of the directories have their own Readme file which describes relevant contents in more detail.
