ON Serialization and Deserialization inside of a QAO context:

For best results, meaning results you'd most likely logically expect, Serialization and
Deserialization should be done by an instance of a class derived from QAO_Base, with the following
recommendations:
 - The instance should do both serialization and deserialization within the same QAO event

 - This instance should have an execution priority value unique across the whole of its runtime

 - The serialization code should lok like this:
   1) Serialize the runtime's state:
      packet << *getRuntime();
   2) Serialize all instances currently in the runtime:
      (best via message method)

 - The deserialization code should lok like this: 
   1) Deserialize the runtime's state:
      packet << *getRuntime();
   2) Deserialize instances:
      hg::util::Deserialize(packet, getRuntime(), MESSAGE_DESERIALIZE); [for example]
